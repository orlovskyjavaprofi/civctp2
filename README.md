## About
This is the Apolyton version of the **Call to Power II** source code based on the released source code from Activision, that did not include the patch. 

[Here you can watch me Alexander Orlovsky playing the original game , so you know what to expect!](https://rumble.com/v1fllu7-lets-play-call-to-power-2-original-activision-version-part-1.html)


**The code has been stripped of comments, but is otherwise complete as far as Activision's code goes.**
In the mean time the Apolyton code was modified so that it works with later versions.

## It was originally built with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0.

## Please notice 
This is **a fork** , which maintained by **Orlovsky Consulting GbR www.orlovskyconsulting.de**

**The game asset files are not included in this repository**, you can get them from 
**the original CD** or **from the [GoG version](https://www.gog.com/game/call_to_power_2).**

## Building the game from sourcecode
**This version of Call to Power 2 Apolyton, works only on Windows!**

This version of Call to Power 2 must be compiled with **Visual Studio Community edition** up from 2022 and **Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)**  lib **(See section Windows build)**

## How to get videos and music from original game and copy it to the apolyton version

## Windows build
https://github.com/orlovskyjavaprofi/civctp2/blob/master/readmeWindows.md

## Installation steps 
https://github.com/orlovskyjavaprofi/civctp2/blob/master/install.md

## Running
Simple **use the installer**, or if its all already prepackaged you run you game where  executable exists, **stay tuned for more info!**
Steam or GOG, well ok then, there game would **be available for free**, but this would be done only if **Microsoft\Activision** sign theirs permission for such realease, we dont violate theirs copyright rights, especially when the original game is sold on the GOG and Steam platform, but i hope they realize , that ***there even more possibilites!**

## Bugs reporting
As it has been said here, my company Orlovsky Consulting GbR does only the maintaince of this project fork, but if you at some point **try original apolyton version** and find bugs , **well you should then contact them first : https://github.com/civctp2/civctp2/issues** . At the moment our codebase different  we at Orlovsky Consulting GbR concentrate for doing **windows only version**, and other original devs they do mostly Linux, **which is not bad**, but different from our goals.

## Feature request
First we need to make sure, **that game runs stable**, if you really think about new features, well you can file a github issue , **but dont expect that we implement it** , **the game is old** and we only interested in **maintaining of it, so it can be played on newer windows**.

**We try to stay in sync with the upstream**, but if we decide to do something differently and on our side the quality improve and well if you find bugs in our version of the game then you can report it via our **issues:** **https://github.com/orlovskyjavaprofi/civctp2/issues**

## Game manual
Read about structure of docu https://github.com/orlovskyjavaprofi/civctp2/blob/master/doc/README.txt , **you need skils in tex in order to compile it into pdf.**
